# (PART) Daily Workflows {-} 

# Useful Git patterns for real life {#workflows-intro .unnumbered}

*most of this only exists in workshop materials but will eventually be recorded here as well*

Git patterns that come up frequently in real work:

  * Commit early and often. The Repeated Amend.
  * Burn it all down.
  * Fork and clone.
  * Adding a remote.
  * Branching.
  * Time travel:
    - "I just need to see the past". Browse and search on GitHub.
    - "I need to visit the past". Create a checkout a branch.
    - "I want to return to the past". `git revert`, `git reset`
    - "I had a great cookie last October". `git cherry pick`, `git checkout REF -- path`
  * [Can't push due to upstream changes?](#pull-tricky)
    - Pull (rebase? merge?), then push. Yay. 
    - Pull, oops merge conflicts, abort. Come back later.
    - Pull, oops merge conflicts, resolve them. Push.


Play well with others:

  * [Make your repo rewarding to browse on GitHub](#workflows-browsability).
  * [Explore and extend a pull request](#pr-extend)
