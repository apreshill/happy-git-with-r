## The repeated amend

A way to commit often, without exposing your WIP on GitHub or without creating a very cluttered history.

Make changes. Reach a decent stopping point. Test, check, if a package ... Render if an analysis .... Nothing broken?

Commit. **Don't push.**

Make more progress. Keep testing or checking or rendering. Inspect diffs to watch what's changing.

Are things broken? Use an appropriate reset to fall back.

Are things improving? Commit but **amend** the previous commit.

Keep going like this until you've built up a commit you can be proud of.

**Now push.**

It is important to not push amended commits unless you really know what you're doing and you can be quite sure that no one else has pulled your work.

## Disaster recovery

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions?sort=votes>

Break it down:

  * Is something wrong with my filesystem/files?
  * Is my git repo messed up?
  * How can I keep this from happening again?
  
Rebase avoidance techniques.

Headless state. Rebase hell.

What to do when you can't, e.g., switch branches. Stashing and WIP commits.

## Engage with R source on GitHub

Browsing

Searching

  * My gist, re: the cran user: <https://gist.github.com/jennybc/4a1bf4e9e1bb3a0a9b56>
  * Recent search for roxygen template usage in the wild: <https://github.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q=man-roxygen+in:path&type=Code&ref=searchresults>

Being a useful useR

  * stay informed re: development
  * use issues for bug reports, feature requests
  * make pull requests
